Once the bot is initialised (which means that it have sent "OK\n"), the game will send him an uuid (to recognise himself) and the bot send once again "OK\n". The game can start!

Players send their bet: "__\n". The game send whether or not the bet is accepted:
    - "Accepted\n" : if it is
    - "bet?\n" : if it isn't. Then the player will have to send his bet again.
The game send the bet of everybody "bets: {b1:__, b2:__, ...}
It send then the winner.


At the end of the game, the game will send "Q\n
